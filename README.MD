# Welcome to the Warehouse coding exercise.

## General information

The idea of this task is to provide more details about your general coding skills. **Please pay attention to the task details**.
If it meets our expectations, then we will invite you to technical interview when it will be discussed.  
Your code will be stored in private repository and removed after recruitment process.
Please complete the task within 7 days.

## Implementation details

* In the Warehouse folder, you can find the Java Maven project that can be imported into your favorite IDE.
* It is a basic project that simulates assets warehouse Java API, where a user can perform basic operations on assets. API contains all required operations.
* Assets can be distinguished with a unique serial number.
* Assets which serial number starts with 'C' are corporate. 
* Corporate Assets should have extended warranty expiration date with one year. 
* We have created an acceptance test package for you, com.example.warehouse, which contains WarehouseApiTest class.
* Currently, all tests are failing. Fix the tests so they successfully pass.

## Important information

* Consider your code as **ready for production**.
* Pay attention to code quality, maintainability, tests, good coding practices, making code thread-safe, etc.
* **You cannot use any database**. Please use plain Java solution for in-memory data management. Adding any database to the project is treated as failed task.
* You can move `WarehouseApiTest` to different package or edit setUp() method, but data setup should be in place.
* You cannot change test methods and setup of the data in `executeWarehouseOperations` inside `WarehouseApiTest`.
* You can modify any other classes, add new classes, add necessary libraries, etc. It is your decision on how you will finish the rest of the task.
## Warning

Please don't post this exercise on ony kind of public repository, such as github. It is for internal use only. Dispose of the code once the technical interview is finished.

## Final words

We would like to respect your time, so please do not spend too much time on this task (2-4 hour should be sufficient to complete the exercise)

Good luck and have fun!
